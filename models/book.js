//Most of this is similar to the author model â€” we've declared a schema with a number of string fields and a virtual for getting the URL of specific book records, and we've exported the model.
//The main difference here is that we've created two references to other models (highlighted in bold above):
// author is a reference to a single Author model object, and is required.
// genre is a reference to an array of Genre model objects. We haven't declared this object yet!
